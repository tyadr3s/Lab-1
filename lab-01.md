Exercise 1:

Processor (CPU) brand, model, and number of cores 

INTEL CORE I7 14 CORES

Total RAM amount and type (DDR4/DDR5) 

16 DDR5

Storage device type (HDD/SSD) and capacity 

SSD 512 GBS

Based on your CPU cores, how many tasks can your processor theoretically handle simultaneously?

14 tasks at once (one per core).

Is your storage primarily HDD or SSD? What are the performance implications?

My storage is only SSD that means that its performance it is better and have a longer durability

How does your RAM amount compare to typical requirements for modern applications?

I think that my RAM can work properly in almost all the applications, because it has the latest DDR5 technology and 16 are enough for all the programs that I have.

Exercise 2:

Which process is using the most resources and why might that be?

The process using the most resources is Microsoft Edge, which is consuming around 1,094 MB of memory. This happens in general the web browsers need to open multiple tabs and processes

What would happen if your OS didn’t manage memory automatically?

If the operating system didn’t manage memory automatically would be imposible to know if the computer’s memory is working properly, for example this lack could cause applications to overwrite the memory of other apllications

How does your OS protect you from security threats?

The OS protects us from security threats for example controlling the permissions apps have or giving the user regular updates to fix new problems or irregularities.
